## Plans for period until end of April 2020
<!--  help text goes here  -->
In this section, list what plans you have for this SIG. Describe each plan according to the following format: 

- **Form**: Bi-weekly sessions on Mondays at 11-12  
- **Content**: Sessions time is usually divided between discussing issues in projects (if any) and following a video talk of a topic of current interest 
- **Sprint**: Organize a workshop on ML for research, where the participants are scientists with limited ML exposure and lots of data. Time: January 20-24



## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?
<!--  help text goes here  -->
+ Increased visibility in the scientific community. This includes: 
  - Participation in workshops, meetups, conferences.
  - Blog posts covering techniques, trends, issues regarding ML/AI.
  - ML training for researchers (e.g. workshop in January, as well as future workshops, courses, trainings we give). 
+ Increased knowledge in ML techniques in the center
+ Better awareness of current ML expertise in the center
